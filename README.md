# calculator.py
Hi, this is my calculator that I programmed. 
It takes in an expression from the user and then returns back an answer. You can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, division (rounded), modulo and exponents. 

When you open the program in your console, you will find instructions on how to perform calculations.

As I am relatively new to python, any feedback would be appreciated. I am hoping to create another one using the same code but in a graphical user interface which looks like a modern computer; so feedback would really help me implement it into my finished product.

Hope you enjoy!
